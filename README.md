This was a really basic experiment to see what it'd be like
to generate physical objects in a procedural manner. I actually
really enjoy working this way. The project here is set up to generate
the files necessary for manufacturing the position feedback sensor
for an optical feedback laser galvanometer. It generates the DXFs
for import into solidworks, a very rudimentary unrouted PCB used to both roughly
position the photodiodes and LEDs, as well as route signals out, and
a very simple output driver using pygame to allow one to have a look at the
outlines and think about the geometry a little easier.

I don't expect this to be very useful to anyone except as a proof of concept.
I'd love to see both more procedural CAD software, and software that
integrates the circuit board as a mechanical element. it's already a
growing trend in the cell phone industry!

Cheers!
